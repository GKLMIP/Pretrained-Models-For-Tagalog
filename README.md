# Pretrained-Models-For-Tagalog

## Introduction
We train three existing models on a much larger corpus: BERT-uncased-base, ELECTRA-uncased-base and RoBERTa-base. At the pre-training stage, we construct a large-scale news text corpus for pre-training in addition to the existing open-source corpora. Besides, a POS tagging dataset is constructed aiming to alleviate the insufficient labeled resource for Tagalog.
